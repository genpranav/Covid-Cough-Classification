# Covid Cough Classification

This project is the application of audio file processing using the concept of MFCCs(Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coeffs) executed using the librosa library
in combination with machine learning concept (Logisitic Regression) to create a ML model that can predict the covid status.
Our model takes audio file of any user as input, evaluates then outputs the prediction.

The features of this project are :
1. MFCCs
2. k-class Logisitic Regression
3. 94% accuracy (with binary Classification with non-uniform training)
4. programing language - python

## Run Locally

As of now only local deployment is possible

## Future Scope
:thought_balloon: currently in work:

:point_right: Modified application of training data to generate a better learning model by readjusting training data to be uniform.

:point_right: Improving mulitclass classification accuracy current accuracy â‰ƒ 80%

:point_right: Application on wider range of test data set.
